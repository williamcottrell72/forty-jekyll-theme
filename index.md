So, what is this thing called data science and why has it become so popular in recent years?  Does machine learning deserve all the hype it is getting, or will this too pass?  Should we be worried about the singularity or is it safe to laugh this one off?

These are questions we need to take seriously.  To lay my cards on the table, "yes", we should be worried, but at the same time we should be intrigued and excited.  Whether for good or for bad, humanity is at a cross roads, but it is not a simple fork, it is a multidimensional random forest of choices. It is possible we make the wrong one, but it is bound to be interesting nonetheless.  

Pass the popcorn, let's try and enjoy the show!
