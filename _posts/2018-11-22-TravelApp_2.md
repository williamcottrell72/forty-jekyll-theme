Today I'll be continuing my discussion of the TravelApp recommender system. Recall that our goal is to take a bunch of user-generated attraction ratings and then use this to make predictions about which attractions a new user might like.  So, our input data looks like this:


<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Golden Gate Bridge</th>
      <th>Alcatraz</th>
      <th> Gregangelo </th>
      <th> SF MoMA </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
      <td> 2 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><font color="red">?</font></td>
      <td> 0 </td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charlie</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td> 5</td>
      <td> 4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Tom </td>
      <td> <font color="red">?</font> </td>
      <td> 2 </td>
      <td> 4 </td>
      <td> 5 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

...and our goal is to figure out where a first-time user of our app would like to visit.  

Now, if our putative new user had *already* rated dozens of attractions then we could just build a collaborative auto-filter, as described in a previous post.  However, we are by assumption interested in a new user who is visiting a new city for the first time.  There probably won't be much overlap between attractions visited by the individual and the ones in a given city.  

So, what should we do?  Clearly, we need to have *some* data on this user in order to get started.  Without anything better, all we can do is ask the user how much they like certain qualities of travel attractions and then try to match them to attractions with similar qualities.  We will call these user-defined features **preferences**.  Since the user will be asked to rate their preference in several categories, we will speak of a **preference vector**.

Now, we also want the power of neural networks so that we can capture non-linearities and keep improving as our information on the user increases.  Thus, our solution is to append the **preference (row) vector** to the row-vector of ratings which we assign to each user.  Of course, for a new user, the ratings will be `NaN`, but then we are back in the situation where we can use the collaborative auto-filter again!
